# Can language models learn from explanations in context?

As language models become more advanced, there is a growing interest in understanding how they learn and make predictions based on the information available to them. In a recent paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a team of researchers explores the ability of language models to learn from explanations in context.

The study uses a modified version of the popular language model GPT-2, which is designed to predict the next word in a sequence of text. In the modified model, the researchers added a layer that takes into account explanations provided in the context of the text. The explanations were simple and consisted of a single sentence providing information about a key concept or event mentioned in the text.

The researchers then tested the model's ability to predict words in a series of texts with and without explanations. They found that the model was able to learn from the explanations and make more accurate predictions about the text. In particular, the model was better at predicting rare or difficult words, suggesting that explanations can help the model understand difficult concepts.
The study also explored how the model used the explanations to make predictions. They found that the model was able to identify key concepts and use the explanations to better understand the relationships between them. For example, in a text about a car accident, the model was able to use the explanation "the car swerved" to predict that the word "crashed" would follow.

Overall, the study suggests that language models can benefit from explanations in context, especially when dealing with difficult or rare concepts. The researchers note that this finding could have important implications for natural language processing and machine learning more broadly, as it suggests that explanations can help models learn and make more accurate predictions.

One of the authors, Felix Hill, highlights the potential applications of this research. "We're really interested in how this can be used in real-world contexts," Hill said. "For example, in education, where teachers might provide explanations to help students understand difficult concepts. This research suggests that language models could also benefit from those explanations and learn more effectively."

In summary, this research paper shows that language models can learn from explanations in context, which can lead to more accurate predictions and better understanding of difficult concepts. This has potential applications in areas such as education, where teachers can provide explanations to help students learn more effectively, and in natural language processing, where models can benefit from explanations to make better predictions.

The researchers explored the ability of language models to learn from explanations provided in context. They found that language models can indeed learn from explanations, and that this ability is enhanced when the explanations are provided in a way that is consistent with the model's existing knowledge. The research also suggests that language models may benefit from more explicit explanations, and that these explanations can help improve their overall performance. Ultimately, the study highlights the importance of context and explanation in language learning and suggests new avenues for improving natural language processing.

The use of language models, such as GPT-3 and BERT, has become increasingly prevalent in natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as question-answering and text generation. However, a major limitation of these models is their inability to understand the context and meaning of words and phrases. In order to overcome this limitation, recent research has focused on developing methods to enable language models to learn from explanations in context.
A recent paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, titled "Learning from Explanations in Context," explores the potential for language models to learn from explanations in context. The paper presents a new dataset, called "CoS-E," which consists of 20,000 instances of natural language explanations given in the context of a variety of reasoning tasks. The authors use this dataset to train and evaluate language models on their ability to learn from explanations in context.
The authors propose a new framework for learning from explanations in context, which they call "Explain2Act." The Explain2Act framework is based on the idea that explanations are a form of instruction, and that language models can learn to use these explanations to guide their actions in a particular context. The framework consists of two main components: a "context encoder" that encodes the current context, and an "explanation decoder" that decodes the explanation to generate an action.
To test the effectiveness of the Explain2Act framework, the authors conduct a series of experiments on the CoS-E dataset. They compare the performance of their framework to several baseline models, including a model that uses only the context information, and a model that uses both the context and the explanation information but does not use the Explain2Act framework.
The results of the experiments show that the Explain2Act framework significantly outperforms the baseline models on a variety of tasks, including question-answering, textual entailment, and natural language inference. The authors also show that the Explain2Act framework is able to learn from explanations in a variety of contexts, including those that involve logical reasoning, spatial reasoning, and visual perception.

The authors conclude that the Explain2Act framework represents a promising new approach to improving the ability of language models to understand the meaning and context of natural language. They suggest that future research should focus on further improving the Explain2Act framework, as well as exploring its potential applications in a variety of NLP tasks.
Overall, the paper presents an exciting new approach to improving the capabilities of language models in understanding natural language. By incorporating explanations in context, the Explain2Act framework has the potential to significantly improve the performance of language models on a wide range of NLP tasks. With further research and development, this framework could have important implications for the field of artificial intelligence and natural language processing.
